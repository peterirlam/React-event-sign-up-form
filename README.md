# react-event-sign-up-form
Demo events sign up form using React

This form is just a demo - it does not submit server side (or accept payment!)

Built mobile first, but easily added to a grid system and respond to larger breakpoints.

I've restricted the dates 2022-10-07, 2022-11-20, 2022-12-01, requiring the user to enter an alternative date.

Users can choose number of attendees which updates client side, adding the correct price.
